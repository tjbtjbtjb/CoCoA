# CoCoA python package

Initial project submitted to the hackathon https://ultrahack.org/covid-19datahack .

As physicists working at CERN experiments or data analysts in physics, used to dealing with big data, we wish to share our knowledge in statistics to the greatest number of people for Covid-19 analysis. Data mining and statistics should help people learn about the most important subject of current history.  For this purpose we have designed the COvid COlab Analysis projet, aka COCOA.

COCOA will provide open source online statistical tools with a simple user interface  and simple modelization schemes. COCOA is based on the Google Colab infrastructure which supplies a popular Python Notebook framework.

This gives the opportunity to have multi-user code editing and huge computing infrastructure (included GPU for future Deep Learning Covid-19 analysis). Moreover an original analysis based on particle physics analysis is under development and should be available soon in COCOA.
